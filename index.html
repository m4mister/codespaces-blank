<p>Hey, this is my homepage, so I have to say something about<br>
<b>myself. Sometimes it is hard to introduce yourself because</b><br>
you know yourself so well that you do not know where to start <br>
with. Let me give a try to see what kind of image <br>
you have about me through my self-description.<br>
I hope that my impression about myself and your<br>
impression about me are not so different. Here it goes.<br></p>
